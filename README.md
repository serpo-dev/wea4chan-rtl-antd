# wea4chan

Weather forecast for nyans... That's a joke. This is my training project where I tested`react-testing-library`. This app uses the external API of `open-meteo.com`.

If you want to review my project and give a feedback, please write on my email (`sergey.potapov.2002@mail.ru`) or telegram (`yphwd`). Thanks for visiting!


## Installation 

Just run the `npm install` if you already have `node v18+` installed.

## Usage

- `npm run test` for test the application (*this is what everything was sterted*)
