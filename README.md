Weather for nyans... That's a joke. The application is just my training project where I have tried `react-testing-library` for the first time. This app uses the external API of `open-meteo.com`.

If you want to review my project and give me a feedback, please write on my email (`sergey.potapov.2002@mail.ru`) or telegram (`yphwd`). Thanks for visiting!


## Installation 

Just run the `npm install` if you already have `node v18+` installed.

## Usage

- `npm run test` for test the application (*this is what everything was sterted*)
- `npm run start` for development mode
- `npm run build` for production mode
