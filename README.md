Kawaii Weather Forecast for NYANS... Yes, we nyan! That's a joke. 'Why not combine cuteness, weather forecast and `react-testing-library`?' - I thought and made this application.  This app uses the external API of `open-meteo.com`.

### Live Demo 🔴

## Usage 😻

Just run the `npm install` if you already have `node v18+` and `npm` installed.

- `npm run test` for test the application (*this is the main reason why the app was created*)
- `npm run start` for development mode
- `npm run build` for production mode
